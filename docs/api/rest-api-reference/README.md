# REST API Reference

This is the reference for the REST API part of Robopipe API. To try out particular endpoints, simply navigate to the appropriate endpoint and click on the "**Test it**" button. All endpoints have included the request and response body schema, along with the restrictions for particular attributes. When running the API, you can also open your locally running docs on [https://robopipe-1.local/docs](https://robopipe-1.local/docs) (Swagger UI). The OpenAPI specification can be downloaded from your server (controller) at [https://robopipe-1.local/openapi.json](https://robopipe-1.local/openapi.json) or below in the _yaml_ format.
