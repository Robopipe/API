# Capsule counting

## Problem description

We want to count capsules placed in a special holder in a machine to see if the holder is full or not. We then want to indicate to the machine that the holder is full which triggers an action on the machine side. We will do this by capturing and labeling our data as we did in our [hello world example](../getting-started/hello-world.md). The we will build a more advanced neural network, deploy it, and link the output to the controller for sending signals to the machine.
